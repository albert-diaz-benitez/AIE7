For example, borrowers reported being unaware of loan transfer statuses, delinquency reports, or overdue payments because they were not properly notified.\\n\\n2. **Mismanagement and Administrative Errors:** Several complaints pointed to issues such as loans being transferred without proper notification, incorrect or mismatched account information, and failure by servicers to provide detailed breakdowns of interest and principal. This mismanagement caused confusion and unintentional missed payments.\\n\\n3. **Difficulty in Re-evaluating Payments or Applying Funds:** Some borrowers found it impossible to apply extra payments toward principal or to pay off smaller loans faster due to restrictive servicer policies, often leading to the accumulation of interest and extending the repayment period.\\n\\n4. **Economic Hardship and Unaffordable Payments:** Even when borrowers attempted to adjust payments or enter income-driven plans, they faced denials or website issues. Many cited financial hardships, stagnant wages, and the burden of high-interest accumulation, making consistent repayment unfeasible.\\n\\n5. **Interest and Fees Accumulating Due to Deferment or Forbearance:** Borrowers who used deferment or forbearance options reported that interest continued to accrue, sometimes negating their payments, which increased overall debt and delayed payoff.\\n\\n6. **Perceived Lack of Transparency:** Many felt misled or poorly informed about interest compounding, late payments, and the actual amount owed, which led to unintentional defaults or delinquency.\\n\\nIn summary, the failures to repay loans often stemmed from communication lapses, administrative mismanagement, restrictive payment policies, financial hardship, and the compounded effect of accruing interest—all of which contributed to borrowers struggling to meet their obligations.\\n'"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

              "\"People failed to pay back their loans for several reasons based on the complaints in the provided data:\\n\\n1. **Accumulation of Interest and Unmanageable Debt:** Many borrowers reported that due to interest continually accruing—especially during forbearance or deferment—they owed significantly more than the original loan amount. This made repayment difficult or impossible, as the total debt grew beyond their means.\\n\\n2. **Limited and Unhelpful Repayment Options:** Borrowers often found the available options—such as forbearance or deferment—to be inadequate, as interest kept piling up. They were sometimes not informed about income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness programs that could make payments more manageable.\\n\\n3. **Mismanagement and Lack of Communication:** Several complaints highlight a failure by servicers to notify borrowers about when repayments would resume, changes in contact information, or the transfer of loans between different servicers without proper notice. This lack of communication led to missed payments and reported delinquencies.\\n\\n4. **Steering into Long-Term Forbearance or Consolidation:** Servicers often placed borrowers into long-term forbearance or pushed them into consolidation without informing them of cheaper or more sustainable options like income-driven plans or rehabilitation, causing their debt to balloon.\\n\\n5. **Errors and Poor Servicing Practices:** Complaints include errors in reporting loan status, misapplication of payments, and improper handling or transfer of loans, which led to negative credit impacts and financial hardship.\\n\\n6. **Lack of Transparency and Documentation:** Borrowers expressed frustration over not receiving clear breakdowns of their balances, interest, or loan details, making it difficult for them to understand or manage their repayment.\\n\\n7. **Economic Hardship and Life Circumstances:** Many borrowers faced financial hardship due to unemployment, health issues, homelessness, or other personal crises, which made it impossible for them to keep up with repayment.\\n\\n8. **Increased Debt Due to Financial Hardship and Market Conditions:** Recessions, inflation, and economic downturns contributed to borrower difficulties, as wages stagnated or declined while debts increased.\\n\\nIn summary, failure to pay back loans was primarily caused by the combination of increased debt from compounded interest, inadequate or misleading information about repayment options, poor communication from servicers, and borrowers' financial hardships.\""

According to consumer complaints, payments were not re-amortized promptly once the forbearance ended. In some cases, borrowers reported that their payment amounts nearly doubled because the new, lower payment plans from during the forbearance were not recalculated immediately. For example, one borrower stated their payment increased from $180 to nearly $360 per month because Nelnet did not re-amortize the loan in a timely manner.\\\\n\\\\nThis delay in re-amortization caused significant impact on borrowers, particularly those who were unprepared for the higher payments. While some borrowers were fortunate enough to handle the increased payments, many expressed concern over the lack of transparency and the potential financial hardship this could cause. Others faced difficulties with account management, such as not being properly informed about their loan status, issues with online access, and delays in payment processing. \\\\n\\\\nIn summary, Nelnet\\'s handling of re-amortization post-forbearance was reported to be delayed, leading to abrupt increases in monthly payments for some borrowers and resulting in confusion, frustration, and potential financial strain.

You may need to pursue legal remedies, such as filing a complaint or lawsuit, to seek damages or loan discharge based on the privacy breach.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the complaints noted, some individuals have requested full cancellation or discharge of their student loans due to violations of their privacy rights and federal laws. For example, there are requests for loan cancellation based on data breaches and violations of rights under FERPA, Privacy Act, and other statutes.\\\\n\\\\nTo proceed, you should consider:\\\\n- Filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education or your loan servicer about the FERPA violation.\\\\n- Consulting with a qualified attorney who specializes in education law or privacy rights to explore possibilities for loan discharge or legal remedies.\\\\n- Monitoring for any official determinations or programs that might offer debt relief due to privacy breaches or federal violations.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary:  \\\\nFERPA violations can negatively affect your personal data security and could potentially lead to legal claims. Some complaints include requests for loan cancellation due to these violations, but such outcomes are not guaranteed and typically require legal action or specific agency rulings.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re seeking to have your loan canceled or forgiven due to a FERPA violation, it\\'s advisable to consult a legal professional to assess your case and guide you through the appropriate procedures.\" additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None} response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 368, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 6245, \\'total_tokens\\': 6613, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_38343a2f8f\\', \\'id\\': \\'chatcmpl-ByEJpFvE04JqrTEWqtFu8huQgIgVD\\', \\'service_tier\\': \\'default\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None} id=\\'run--1c5a62b9-97fa-4598-9961-606d17243c5e-0\\' usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 6245, \\'output_tokens\\': 368, \\'total_tokens\\': 6613, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}}', multi_responses=None, reference='My personal and financial data was compromised violating FERPA.

However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn\\'t know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I\\'m also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that.

That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file.

She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ).

Borrowers are often steered into forbearance instead of exploring more sustainable repayment options, leading to unanticipated complications later on.\\\\n   - When borrowers are not properly informed of their options, they may inadvertently enter into and remain in long-term forbearances or undergo coercive consolidations, which can increase their debt burden and reduce their ability to effectively manage repayment.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Impact of Post-Forbearance Payment Increases:**  \\\\n   - The second segment notes that, after the COVID-19 forbearance ended, some borrowers experienced significant increases in monthly payments due to delayed re-amortization of their loans (e.g., payments nearly doubling from $180 to $360).  \\\\n   - Without timely re-amortization, borrowers face larger monthly payments that may be unaffordable, especially if they were already in a tight financial situation during or after the pandemic forbearance period.\\\\n\\\\n**How These Issues Contribute to Financial Hardship and Difficulty:**  \\\\n- **Unexpected Payment Burdens:** Borrowers may be unprepared for sudden increases in monthly payments due to lack of communication regarding re-amortization, leading to missed payments, default risks, or further financial strain.  \\\\n- **Loss of Benefits and Increased Debt:** Coerced consolidations or long-term forbearance use can cause interest capitalization and reset forgiveness clocks, increasing total debt and decreasing prospects for loan forgiveness.  \\\\n- **Reduced Control and Limited Options:** The absence of clear communication disorients borrowers, making it harder to identify legal repayment options such as income-driven plans or rehabilitation, which could make payments more manageable.\\\\n\\\\n**Concerns for Borrowers Managing Student Loans:**  \\\\n- Borrowers may feel trapped in cycles of forbearance or unaffordable payments with little awareness of options that could reduce their financial burden.  \\\\n- Lack of transparency and systemic servicing failures can lead to ongoing uncertainty, stress, and worsening financial health.  \\\\n- The potential for unanticipated payment increases after loan re-amortization poses a particular risk, especially for those with limited financial flexibility.  \\\\n- Overall, these issues raise concerns about borrower protections, the effectiveness of communication from servicers, and the adequacy of systemic safeguards to prevent financial hardship related to student loans.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, unclear communication during service changes, combined with delayed or unexpected payment adjustments post-forbearance, can exacerbate borrower hardship, undermine their ability to manage student debt effectively, and increase the risk of default or long-term financial difficulties.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 565, 'prompt_tokens': 3924, 'total_tokens': 4489, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_38343a2f8f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-ByEEBlR7bUriRB9UkioLF8vIqB920', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--6b5d6ab6-ec74-4cec-8326-91022c07df68-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3924, 'output_tokens': 565, 'total_tokens': 4489, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"The confusion regarding loan servicer changes, as described in the first context segment, can make it difficult for borrowers to know where to send payments, potentially resulting in missed or late payments and the accrual of extra interest or fees.

For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

When applications are delayed or not processed, servicers may default to higher payment amounts or assign incorrect payment plans.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Incorrect Payment Calculations:**  \\\\n   Some borrowers received bills with amounts not aligned with their income, often due to errors or miscalculations by the servicer. For example, one case describes an erroneous $XXXX/month payment assigned despite low income.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Misapplication or Lack of Follow-up on Recertification:**  \\\\n   Even after submitting recertification documents, some borrowers see their application status pending or unprocessed, leading to automatic assignment of higher payment amounts or default payments that do not reflect their current income.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Interest Accrual During Incomplete Processing:**  \\\\n   Due to court injunctions and ongoing litigation, servicers might be delayed in enrolling borrowers in the SAVE Plan or properly implementing the recertification, causing temporary or improper interest accrual or higher payments.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Potential Administrative Errors or Miscommunication:**  \\\\n   Some complaints suggest servicers may have provided incorrect information, failed to apply payments properly, or credited payments improperly, resulting in higher balances and payments.\\\\n\\\\nIn your case, even though you\\'ve recertified your income correctly and have low income, the high payment amount might be due to servicer delays, errors in application, or incorrect billing following recertification. It\\'s advisable to:\\\\n- Follow up with your servicer in writing requesting clarification and correction.\\\\n- Document all communications.\\\\n- Consider filing a complaint with the CFPB if errors persist, as many borrowers have experienced similar issues with servicer processing and billing under the SAVE Plan.\\\\n\\\\nIf you believe your application was correctly submitted and you are still being billed incorrectly, seeking assistance through a loan ombudsman or submitting a formal complaint can help resolve these discrepancies.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**  \\\\nYour high SAVE Plan payment despite low income likely results from processing delays, administrative errors, or miscalculations by your loan servicer, even after recertification.\" additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None} response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 478, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 6892, \\'total_tokens\\': 7370, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_38343a2f8f\\', \\'id\\': \\'chatcmpl-ByELF4plj6D8S13l1aYT9ez6m3U3W\\', \\'service_tier\\': \\'default\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None} id=\\'run--271419dd-de35-42b2-b4ad-6e65ccd7550f-0\\' usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 6892, \\'output_tokens\\': 478, \\'total_tokens\\': 7370, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}}', multi_responses=None, reference='Under the SAVE Plan, with income below 150% of the federal poverty guideline, the payment should be $ XXXX monthly.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.', 'Nelnet can not why my balance is increasing while in forbearance.

Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments \\'\\' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX \\'s recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage.

I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out.

I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account.

Ive contacted the loan servicer, but they have refused to remove the late payment.

I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing this matter and encouraging the servicer to make a one-time goodwill adjustment.\", 'Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments \\'\\' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX \\'s recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX.', \"The only option that were offered were to either put, my loans into forbearance or deferment. While these were accessible early on as a payment option, interest on each loan continued to accumulate, which placed me in a difficult position when payments resumed. If I lowered my monthly payments, the interest alone would negate any payments made and would continue accumulate and extending the time needed to payoff the total amount owed. If that were to happen it would inevitably increase the total interest per loan over time, snowballing into a greater total sum. \\n\\nAfter XXXX years of making payments on a {$16000.00} loan ( XXXX subsidized & XXXX unsubsidized ) from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, I still have a balance of {$15000.00} and I see no way of paying this off by estimated payoff date of XXXX. If I were to increase monthly payments, I would not be able to afford my bills, day to day necessities, food, and transportation to and from work. All available options offered to me would extend the period of time needed to payoff the loans and increase the amounts necessary to pay it off. \\n\\nMany student loans borrowers, including myself, do not qualified for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or Teacher Loan Forgiveness ( TLF ). We took on these loans at a young age, assuming that by graduation we would have secured jobs that could support both student debt repayment and basic living expenses. However, I feel mislead by loan servicers due to lack of information provided about compounding interest, inflation, and stagnant wages all of which make monthly repayment an unrealistic expectation. \\n\\nThese financial hardships are not only limited to public servants. Today 's economy is made up of, but not limited to contract works, freelancers, and home aides all of whom contribute significantly to society. While I fully support loan forgiveness for public servants, I also believe that this benefit should be offered to those who do not qualify under ( PSLF or TLF ).

However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments.

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \\n\\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \\n\\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.', 'Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments \\'\\' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX \\'s recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX.', \"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.\", \"The only option that were offered were to either put, my loans into forbearance or deferment. While these were accessible early on as a payment option, interest on each loan continued to accumulate, which placed me in a difficult position when payments resumed. If I lowered my monthly payments, the interest alone would negate any payments made and would continue accumulate and extending the time needed to payoff the total amount owed. If that were to happen it would inevitably increase the total interest per loan over time, snowballing into a greater total sum. \\n\\nAfter XXXX years of making payments on a {$16000.00} loan ( XXXX subsidized & XXXX unsubsidized ) from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, I still have a balance of {$15000.00} and I see no way of paying this off by estimated payoff date of XXXX. If I were to increase monthly payments, I would not be able to afford my bills, day to day necessities, food, and transportation to and from work. All available options offered to me would extend the period of time needed to payoff the loans and increase the amounts necessary to pay it off. \\n\\nMany student loans borrowers, including myself, do not qualified for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or Teacher Loan Forgiveness ( TLF ). We took on these loans at a young age, assuming that by graduation we would have secured jobs that could support both student debt repayment and basic living expenses. However, I feel mislead by loan servicers due to lack of information provided about compounding interest, inflation, and stagnant wages all of which make monthly repayment an unrealistic expectation. \\n\\nThese financial hardships are not only limited to public servants. Today 's economy is made up of, but not limited to contract works, freelancers, and home aides all of whom contribute significantly to society. While I fully support loan forgiveness for public servants, I also believe that this benefit should be offered to those who do not qualify under ( PSLF or TLF ). Millions of borrowers across various professions are buried under unmanageable student debt and continue to struggle financially not because of irresponsibility, but because they were denied a chance at financial stability simply due to not having the right job title.\", \"To Whom It May Concern, On XX/XX/year>, I experienced a significant and devastating drop in my credit scores : from approximately XXXX to XXXX on Experian, and from XXXX to XXXX on TransUnion. As a XXXX individual who has spent my entire adult life building and maintaining strong credit, this sudden decline has been not only financially damaging but also deeply disheartening. \\n\\nPrior to these recent Department of Education loan reports, my credit history was overwhelmingly positive, marked by over 99 % of on-time payments with only a few isolated XXXX  days past due occurrences, each of which were accidental and never reflective of an unwillingness to meet my obligations. I have consistently chosen to carry loans and pay extended interest to build and preserve my credit. This recent event has left me feeling utterly defeated, with the prospect of spending the next XXXX years working to rebuild my score seeming nearly insurmountable. \\n\\nIn the past week, Ive read hundreds, if not thousands of testimonies from others who are enduring the exact same hardship. It is clear that this issue is not the result of individual negligence, but rather the consequence of a systemic breakdown impacting people nationwide. \\n\\nBefore this change, I had approximately {$96000.00} in available credit card lines, of which only about 2 % was utilized. Now, with my credit scores severely affected, my available credit has been slashed to nearly nothing. As a result, I am currently unable to secure financing for a vehicle, a home, or any other need that depends on a functional credit score. \\n\\nThe student loans in question were placed in forbearance while I pursued XXXX XXXX ( becoming a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and during the federal Covid-related pause. During this time, the loans were transferred to Nelnet and fragmented into XXXX separate accounts. Despite my efforts, including submitting paperwork on multiple occasions during the forbearance period and calling and talking to representatives, I was unable to complete the consolidation process or establish a manageable repayment plan. Importantly, these loans remained in forbearance throughout this time. \\n\\nFollowing the credit report changes on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to speak with a representative at Nelnet, who graciously assisted in placing the loans back into forbearance ( after which they had been removed to forbearance without me understanding what was going on ) to allow time for consolidation and payment setup. I want to emphasize that I have never had the intention to avoid repaying any debt I owe or any debt I've ever owed. My long-standing credit record serves as a testament to that commitment. \\n\\nTo characterize this situation as frustrating would be a gross understatement. The complexity and opacity of the current loan servicing and credit reporting system are overwhelming even to the most diligent and responsible individuals. There is a clear and urgent need for reform. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have received student loans, as they allowed me to pursue an education that would not have been possible otherwise. I did not have familial financial support, and without a degree, I would never have had access to a job that could support repayment or my family entirely. \\n\\nHowever, many of us who have tried to do everything right now find ourselves in crisis. The system, as it stands, is failing the very people it was meant to empower, hardworking individuals striving to better themselves and contribute meaningfully to our country. We need help. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Additional information for the incorrect & inconsistency in the reporting process that was misleading to all borrowers ( attached document ).\", \"I was enrolled in automatic payments for my federal student loan prior to the COVID-19 forbearance period. During the pause, auto-debit was suspended. When payments resumed, I was not notified by my servicer that auto-pay would not restart automatically. As a result, I unintentionally missed three payments and was marked 90 days delinquent on my credit report. \\n\\nI brought the account current as soon as I discovered the error. Ive contacted the loan servicer, but they have refused to remove the late payment. I believe this negative mark is the result of a failure in communication and servicer procedures, not intentional nonpayment on my part. I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing this matter and encouraging the servicer to make a one-time goodwill adjustment.\", 'Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela.

Here\\'s how:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Lack of Clear Information and Communication:**  \\\\n   Borrowers often rely on their servicers for accurate, timely information about their loans. When servicers provide inconsistent, opaque, or incomplete information—such as unexplained increases in payments, missing notices about payment adjustments, or uncommunicated servicer transfers—they cannot plan their finances effectively. This confusion can lead to missed or late payments, credit score damage, and increased financial stress.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Unexpected Payment Increases Post-Forbearance:**  \\\\n   After the COVID-19 forbearance ended, some borrowers experienced sudden, substantial hikes in their monthly payments (e.g., nearly doubling from $180 to $360 or even higher without clear warning). These increases can strain borrowers\\' budgets, especially if they were not anticipating such changes. Even borrowers who can handle the higher payments face the challenge of integrating these costs into their household budgets, potentially leading to missed payments or default risk.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Discrepancies and Errors in Loan Balances and Interest Calculations:**  \\\\n   Several complaints describe loans increasing unexpectedly due to errors, system glitches, or misunderstandings about interest capitalization. Such errors can inflate loan balances, making repayment harder and prolonging the debt burden, increasing the likelihood of hardship.\\\\n\\\\n**Contributing to Borrower Hardship and Difficulties:**  \\\\n- **Financial Strain:** Unforeseen payment jumps coupled with unclear or conflicting information can lead borrowers to miss payments, fall behind, or default.  \\\\n- **Credit Impact:** Missed or late payments, marked as delinquent, can damage credit scores and reduce borrowing capacity for other needs like home ownership.  \\\\n- **Emotional and Mental Stress:** The opacity and unpredictability of loan management can cause anxiety, frustration, and a sense of helplessness, making it even harder to focus on financial stability.\\\\n\\\\n**Concerns for Borrowers Managing Student Loans:**  \\\\n- They may lack confidence in the fairness and transparency of the loan servicing system.  \\\\n- They might be unaware of available options like income-driven repayment plans or processes to address errors.  \\\\n- They could face prolonged financial hardship if errors or miscommunications lead to unmanageable debt growth or missed opportunities for loan relief or forgiveness.\\\\n\\\\n**In summary**, these issues can trap borrowers in a cycle of confusion and financial difficulty, heightening the risk of default and long-term hardship.

When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. \\'\\' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. \\'\\' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company.'], reference_contexts=[\"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX.

You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX.

I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. \\'\\' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. \\'\\' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \\n\\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate.

As a XXXX individual who has spent my entire adult life building and maintaining strong credit, this sudden decline has been not only financially damaging but also deeply disheartening. \\n\\nPrior to these recent Department of Education loan reports, my credit history was overwhelmingly positive, marked by over 99 % of on-time payments with only a few isolated XXXX  days past due occurrences, each of which were accidental and never reflective of an unwillingness to meet my obligations. I have consistently chosen to carry loans and pay extended interest to build and preserve my credit. This recent event has left me feeling utterly defeated, with the prospect of spending the next XXXX years working to rebuild my score seeming nearly insurmountable. \\n\\nIn the past week, Ive read hundreds, if not thousands of testimonies from others who are enduring the exact same hardship. It is clear that this issue is not the result of individual negligence, but rather the consequence of a systemic breakdown impacting people nationwide. \\n\\nBefore this change, I had approximately {$96000.00} in available credit card lines, of which only about 2 % was utilized. Now, with my credit scores severely affected, my available credit has been slashed to nearly nothing. As a result, I am currently unable to secure financing for a vehicle, a home, or any other need that depends on a functional credit score. \\n\\nThe student loans in question were placed in forbearance while I pursued XXXX XXXX ( becoming a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and during the federal Covid-related pause. During this time, the loans were transferred to Nelnet and fragmented into XXXX separate accounts. Despite my efforts, including submitting paperwork on multiple occasions during the forbearance period and calling and talking to representatives, I was unable to complete the consolidation process or establish a manageable repayment plan. Importantly, these loans remained in forbearance throughout this time. \\n\\nFollowing the credit report changes on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to speak with a representative at Nelnet, who graciously assisted in placing the loans back into forbearance ( after which they had been removed to forbearance without me understanding what was going on ) to allow time for consolidation and payment setup. I want to emphasize that I have never had the intention to avoid repaying any debt I owe or any debt I've ever owed. My long-standing credit record serves as a testament to that commitment. \\n\\nTo characterize this situation as frustrating would be a gross understatement. The complexity and opacity of the current loan servicing and credit reporting system are overwhelming even to the most diligent and responsible individuals. There is a clear and urgent need for reform. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have received student loans, as they allowed me to pursue an education that would not have been possible otherwise. I did not have familial financial support, and without a degree, I would never have had access to a job that could support repayment or my family entirely. \\n\\nHowever, many of us who have tried to do everything right now find ourselves in crisis. The system, as it stands, is failing the very people it was meant to empower, hardworking individuals striving to better themselves and contribute meaningfully to our country. We need help. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Additional information for the incorrect & inconsistency in the reporting process that was misleading to all borrowers ( attached document ).\", 'I took out federal student loans with Nelnet in XXXX for an engineering program that I was in. XXXX ended that and I moved across the country.The government deferred payments on the student loans for XXXX to XXXX years and apparently have just restarted payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any communication from Nelnet regarding the startup of these payments, partially my fault due to the changes in my contact information. However, I was just notified by a XXXX XXXX alert that I had received a XXXX delinquency on their loan which I have only XXXX payment, XXXX have separated into XXXX separate loans thus reported XXXX separate XXXX  day delinquent notifications that reduced my XXXX XXXX by XXXX points overnight. I contacted them and immediately paid the past due balance plus the current month and intend on fully paying every single month until this loan is resolved. There was poor communication in regards to when these loans were going to restart and I did not receive any notification personally. Due to laws allowing them to not report delinquent payments until XXXX days. I was then hit with a XXXX day delinquency on a loan that I make XXXX payment on, but they have split into XXXX accounts. Thus giving me XXXX separate XXXX day delinquent payments on my credit report dropping my credit from a rising XXXX to XXXX overnight. This completely destroyed my credit for years to come. Up to XXXX XXXX students are facing the same situation and there are hundreds of thousands of people online complaining about the same thing happening to them. Nelnet, due to the way that they report delinquencies only has to report it after XXXX days, not giving me the opportunity to make current before a catastrophic credit reduction. There are news articles all over the XXXX and XXXX with thousands of responses from people having the same situation happen to them. I asked Nelnet if since I immediately resolved the past due balance, if there was any way that they could do me a XXXX time favor and remove those derogatory marks from my credit reporting to save my credit after never having a prior late payment. They said no, and it was my problem. Considering the millions of people who are affected by this, and the lack of communication and transparency involved in making students aware after XXXX  years of deferred repayment. I immediately resolved the balance with intent to pay the entire balance off within a year. I believe these late payments were due to lack of communication and nothing else. I believe that with my good faith payment resolving the past due balance, and the current month due that combined with the XXXX of any prior reporting at XXXX or XXXX days, thus notifying me in order to resolve it prior to the XXXX  day mark, which has such a huge impact on my XXXX XXXX that I should be able to request the removal of those XXXX  day delinquencies from my credit report. Nelnet refuses to assist even after correcting this balance, but this is going to set me back for years to come and hurt me in areas essential to my growth and contribution to society. Due to the widespread amount of people affected by this, I hope that there is a plan in place to help honest, hard-working citizens from losing their ability to grow and contribute to the society and economy. I take responsibility for letting it slip my mind after XXXX years of deferred payments mandated by the XXXX government and have steadily grown my credit score over the last XXXX years to get to the point where I was. This is devastating to me and thousands and thousands of other Americans. Due to the abnormality of this long-term student loan, deferment and lack of communication I believe that at the very least they should be accepting XXXX letters and removing those negative marks from my credit report.

This situation may be caused by a processing delay or error in your loan servicer\\'s system, such as Aidvantage, not accurately recalculating your payment based on your documented income. Some possible reasons include:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Pending Processing of Your Application:** Your application for the SAVE Plan may still be in the processing queue, so the system hasn\\'t yet updated your payment amount appropriately. As noted in your complaint, there are indications that your application has not been fully processed or there are administrative delays.\\\\n\\\\n2. **System Errors or Administrative Confusion:** The servicer might have issued an incorrect bill due to administrative errors, as seen in your case where there\\'s mention of bills being generated before application processing was complete, or incorrect refunds and payments being applied.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Lack of Communication or Additional Documentation Requests:** If the servicer hasn\\'t requested or received additional documentation necessary to recalculate your payment accurately, this could prevent your payment from being adjusted.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Automatic Billing Based on Previous Plans:** Sometimes, until your application and income documentation are fully approved and processed, the system may default to a standard or previous plan payment amount, which could be higher than your actual new plan amount.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the complexities of these issues and the delays in processing your application, the high payment you\\'re seeing is likely due to administrative or technical delays rather than your actual income qualification.

My loans have been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I was on IBR Plan until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was told to switch to SAVE Plan by my servicer EDFinancial. I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ).

For borrowers with limited financial flexibility, such increases are difficult to manage and may result in missed payments, default, or further financial hardship.\\\\n\\\\n**Concerns for Borrowers:**\\\\n\\\\n- **Increased Financial Strain:** Unexpectedly high payments or inefficient repayment strategies can overwhelm borrowers’ budgets, impairing their ability to meet other essential needs like housing, healthcare, or transportation.\\\\n  \\\\n- **Loss of Benefits and Equity:** Coerced consolidations and unawareness of income-driven repayment or rehabilitation options can cause borrowers to lose eligibility for forgiveness programs and increase their overall debt load, prolonging their repayment struggles.\\\\n\\\\n- **Systemic Vulnerability and Distrust:** Repeated communication failures and aggressive servicing practices erode borrower trust and may discourage borrowers from seeking help or understanding their rights, further exacerbating their financial difficulties.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, these issues highlight the importance of transparent, proactive communication from servicers, and the need for borrowers to have clear information about all available repayment options to prevent unnecessary hardship.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 368, 'prompt_tokens': 3924, 'total_tokens': 4292, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_38343a2f8f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-ByFwD6fGvohbatJNJWyrBek1BAtcU', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--7e6fd1c0-9ad9-487f-aefc-e84283059a71-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3924, 'output_tokens': 368, 'total_tokens': 4292, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"The confusion regarding loan servicer changes, as described in the first context segment, can make it difficult for borrowers to know where to send payments, potentially resulting in missed or late payments and the accrual of extra interest or fees.

When Ive tried to speak with them on the phone, they give me the run around and cant properly explain why their form has room for only one entry.

Here\\'s how:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Uncertainty About Loan Servicer and Payment Details:**  \\\\n   When borrowers are not properly informed or face inconsistencies about which servicer manages their loans or are not notified promptly about changes, they may be unable to access accurate account information. This confusion can delay payments, lead to missed or late payments, and increase stress.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Delays and Errors in Payment Re-amortization:**  \\\\n   The failure to re-amortize payments after forbearance ends, as described, means that borrowers may be faced with unexpectedly higher monthly payments (nearly doubling in some cases). For borrowers with limited financial flexibility, this sudden increase can result in missed payments, default risks, and further financial instability.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Lack of Clear Communication and Transparency:**  \\\\n   When borrowers are not receiving timely, accurate, or comprehensive updates—such as the status of their loan, servicer changes, or correct repayment amounts—they lack the information needed to plan their finances effectively. This can lead to anxiety, mismanagement of funds, and unintentionally falling into delinquency.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Technical and Administrative Issues:**  \\\\n   Problems like auto-debit setups not processing correctly, conflicting information from servicers, or difficulty obtaining assistance exacerbate the problem, potentially causing additional late fees, accruing interest, and damage to credit scores.\\\\n\\\\n**Concerns for Borrowers Trying to Manage Student Loans Include:**  \\\\n- The risk of unexpected payment increases and the inability to plan finances accordingly.  \\\\n- Difficulties in verifying account status or understanding repayment obligations.  \\\\n- Increased stress and potential for default due to communication failures and administrative errors.  \\\\n- Frustration and distrust in the loan servicing system, which can hinder proactive loan management.  \\\\n- Potential legal or credit report issues resulting from misreported loan statuses or default declarations caused by servicer mishandling.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, these issues can significantly impair a borrower\\'s capacity to meet repayment obligations, elevate financial hardship, and diminish confidence in managing their student loan debt effectively.\" additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None} response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 464, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 5315, \\'total_tokens\\': 5779, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_38343a2f8f\\', \\'id\\': \\'chatcmpl-ByG4haltB4R7cqIDpfqYey35a6jkE\\', \\'service_tier\\': \\'default\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None} id=\\'run--51e9dab8-9cad-4872-a883-d41c3e02525d-0\\' usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 5315, \\'output_tokens\\': 464, \\'total_tokens\\': 5779, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}}', multi_responses=None, reference=\"The confusion regarding loan servicer changes, as described in the first context segment, can make it difficult for borrowers to know where to send payments, potentially resulting in missed or late payments and the accrual of extra interest or fees.
